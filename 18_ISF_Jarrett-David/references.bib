	journal={International Journal of Forecasting},
	volume={17},
	number={2},
	pages={143-157},
	abstract={Rule-based forecasting (RBF) is an expert system that uses features of time series to select and weight extrapolation techniques. Thus, it is dependent upon the identification of features of the time series. Judgmental coding of these features is expensive and the reliability of the ratings is modest. We developed and automated heuristics to detect six features that had previously been judgmentally identified in RBF: outliers, level shifts, change in basic trend, unstable recent trend, unusual last observation, and functional form. These heuristics rely on simple statistics such as first differences and regression estimates. In general, there was agreement between automated and judgmental codings for all features other than functional form. Heuristic coding was more sensitive than judgment and consequently, identified more series with a certain feature than judgmental coding. We compared forecast accuracy using automated codings with that using judgmental codings across 122 series. Forecasts were produced for six horizons, resulting in a total of 732 forecasts. Accuracy for $30\%$ of the 122 annual time series was similar to that reported for RBF. For the remaining series, there were as many that did better with automated feature detection as there were that did worse. In other words, the use of automated feature detection heuristics reduced the costs of using RBF without negatively affecting forecast accuracy.},

	abstract={Strategic energy planning processes, which include natural gas demand, are commonly used as a tool to design the regional and local energy system and encourage renewable energy development. The oil and natural gas market plays a very important role in the strategic energy planning process in a country. In recent years, natural gas consumption has become the fastest growing primary energy source in Turkey. In this study, natural gas consumptions of Turkey in different time periods are forecasted by using various time series methods such as exponential smoothing, winters’ forecasting and Box-Jenkins methods. These methods are compared with each other in terms of the superiority in forecasting performance. The findings reveal that in the yearly data set, double exponential smoothing model outperforms the other alternative forecasting models. On the other hand, in term of monthly data set, SARIMA model provides the better results than the others.},

	abstract={This paper proposed the combination of two statistical techniques for the detection and imputation of outliers in time series data. An autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) model is used to extract the characteristics of the time series and to find the residuals. The outliers are detected by performing hypothesis testing on the extrema of the residuals and the anomalous data are imputed using another ARIMAX model. The process is performed in an iterative way because at the beginning the process, the residuals are contaminated by the anomalies and therefore, the ARIMAX model needs to be re-learned on “cleaner” data at every step. We test the algorithm using both synthetic and real data sets and we present the analysis and comments on those results.},

	title={Long-Range Forecasting for a Consumer Durable in an International Market},
	journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
	keywords={Social sciences; Business costs; 0505:Business costs},
	abstract={There has been a substantial amount of interest recently in long-range planning. One necessary component of the long-range plan Is the long-range forecast. In contrast to the emphasis on the planning process, however, little attention has been given to forecasting. This study considers the problem of long-range forecasting in a situation which is of growing importance - forecasting sales for international markets.Many researchers appear to operate under the impression that causal models (i.e., models based on an analysis of underlying factors) lead to more accurate sales forecasts than those provided by naive models (i.e., projections based on historical sales data only). A survey of the research literature led to the conclusion that this confidence in causal models is virtually unsupported. One can hardly criticize firms, then, for relying primarily upon naive models for sales forecasting since these models are simpler and less expensive than causal model.This study was based on the hypothesis that causal models are superior to naive models in certain situations. The key element of these situations is that -there are 'large changes.' Long-range sales forecasting usually involves such large changes; and there are many reasons to expect that long-range forecasting for international markets is a situation in which substantial changes will occur (e.g., the Kennedy round tariff cuts and the formation of common markets.)A causal model was developed to provide long-range forecasts of the international market for still cameras. This model provided unconditional forecasts of unit camera sales by country for year t n on the basis of l) knowledge about camera sales in year t and 2) predicted changes in four causal variables from year t to t n. These four causal variables included, in order of importance, per capita income, price of cameras, number of potential buyers and quality of cameras.The predictive ability of the causal model was superior to that of a naive model purporting to represent current practice. Each model was used to provide backcasts of 1954 camera sales in 17 countries on the basis of data from 1967 to 1960 only. The mean absolute percentage error for the causal model was 23\% while that for the naive model was 43\%. This result was statistically significant (0? = .05); but, more importantly, it appeared to have great practical significance. An evaluation, based on very conservative subjective estimates, indicated that such an improvement in accuracy would have a present value worth in excess of one percent of a typical firm's yearly sales volume.Further support for the use of the causal model was obtained by noting that the standard errors of the estimated relationships were low (evidence of reliability), that the estimates of causal relationships from different measurement models were in rather close agreement (evidence of construct validity), and that the causal model performed well in another situation where predictions were provided for I960-65 camera sales in 11 'new' countries (evidence of concurrent validity).The causal relationships were initially specified by a subjective analysis. Various parts of the causal model were then updated by use of a number of measurement models including an analysis of differences among sales rates for 30 countries, of differences among changes in the sales rates from 1961 to 1965 for 21 countries, and of differences among six income categories from United States household survey data. This updating led to a modest, though valuable, gain as the mean absolute percentage error of the 1954 backcast was reduced from 30\% to the 23\% mentioned above.Additional benefits associated with the development of the causal model included the ability to evaluate large changes in the market; to estimate current sales where trade and production figures are inadequate; to evaluate alternative assumptions about the future rapidly and cheaply; and to identify markets which have not been fully exploited.In summary, the study argues that the development of better long-range forecasting models is an important problem; describes the development of causal models; and demonstrates the superiority of causal models over naive models in a case involving long-range forecasting for international markets.},

	journal={Econometrica},
	volume={34},
	number={3},
	pages={585-612},
	abstract={In this paper, we consider two basic aspects of demand analysis, with application to the demand for natural gas in the residential and commercial market. The more fundamental one consists in the formulation of a demand function for commodities--such as natural gas--whose consumption is technologically related to the stock of appliances. We believe that in such markets, the behavior of the consumer can be described best in terms of a dynamic mechanism. Related to this is the more specific problem of estimating the parameters of the demand function, when the demand model is cast in dynamic terms and when observations are drawn from a time series of cross sections. Accordingly, this paper is centered around these two major themes, although, as the title suggests, the emphasis is placed on the second one. In Section 1, we present the theoretical formulation of the dynamic model for gas. In Section 2, the results of the estimation of the gas model by ordinary least squares methods are presented. These results, together with more fundamental theoretical considerations, suggest a different approach. The essence of this approach, which is not restricted to the gas model, is discussed in Section 3, while two alternative procedures for estimating the coefficients of the dynamic model in the light of this new approach are proposed in Section 4. It is subsequently shown that the application of these procedures to the gas data produces results that are reasonable on the basis of a priori theoretical considerations.},

	booktitle={IEEE Power and Energy Society 2015 Conference},
	location={Denver, Colorado, USA},
	abstract={Short data sets in natural gas forecasting inadequately represent the range of consumption patterns necessary for forecasting accuracy, limiting the ability of gas utilities to lower customer costs. In contrast, larger data sets present a wide range of customer characteristics, but their long-term historical trends must be adjusted to resemble recent data before models can be developed. While many forecasting techniques adjust by extrapolating smoothed trends, natural gas consumption trends are not smooth. Our approach detrends historical natural gas data using a domain-based five-parameter model. The model is validated by applying data detrended by it to regression-based gas consumption forecasting methods. When presented with series detrended by the five-parameter model, regression forecasts were more accurate than when using non-detrended data or data detrended by benchmark methods. Additionally, forecast errors for non-detrended series increased as more years were used for model development. The opposite was observed with detrended series.},

	journal={Ecology},
	volume={86},
	number={5},
	pages={1114-1123},
	abstract={The probability of a rare event is usually estimated directly as the number of times the event occurs divided by the total sample size. Unfortunately, the precision of this estimate is low. For typical sample sizes of N < 100 in ecological studies, the coefficient of variation (cv) of this estimate of the probability of a rare event can exceed $300\%$. Sample sizes on the order of 103-104 observations are needed to reduce the cv to below $10\%$. If it is impractical or impossible to increase the sample size, auxiliary data can be used to improve the precision of the estimate. We describe four approaches for using auxiliary data to improve the precision of estimates of the probability of a rare event: (1) Bayesian analysis that includes prior information about the probability; (2) stratification that incorporates information on the heterogeneity in the population; (3) regression models that account for information correlated with the probability; and (4) inclusion of aggregated data collected at larger spatial or temporal scales. These approaches are illustrated using data on the probability of capture of vespulid wasps by the insectivorous plant Darlingtonia californica. All four methods increase the precision of the estimate relative to the simple frequency-based estimate (absolute precision = 1.26, relative precision [cv] = $70\%$): stratification (absolute precision = 1.10, cv = $62\%$); regression models (absolute precision = 1.59, cv = $55\%$); Bayesian analysis with an informative prior probability distribution (absolute precision = 4.28, cv = $47\%$); and using temporally aggregated data (absolute precision = 6.75, cv = $36\%$). When informative auxiliary data is available, we recommend including it when estimating the probability of rare events.},

	pages={94},
	abstract={This thesis presents a new method of estimating the one-in-N low temperature threshold using a non-parametric statistical method called kernel density estimation applied to daily average wind-adjusted temperatures. We present our One-in-N Algorithm to local gas distribution companies (LDCs), as they have to forecast the daily natural gas needs of their consumers. In winter, demand for natural gas is high. Low temperatures are not directly related to an LDCs gas demand forecasting, but knowledge of extreme low temperatures is important to ensure that an LDC has enough capacity to meet customer demands when extreme low temperatures are experienced.   We present a detailed explanation of the One-in-N Algorithm and compare it to the methods using the generalized extreme value distribution, the normal distribution, and the variance-weighted composite distribution. We show that our One-in-N Algorithm estimates the one-in-N low temperature threshold more accurately than the methods using the generalized extreme value distribution, the normal distribution, and the variance-weighted composite distribution according to root mean square error (RMSE) measure at a $5\%$ level of significance. The One-in-N Algorithm is tested by counting the number of times the daily average wind-adjusted temperature is less than or equal to the one-in-N low temperature threshold.},

	abstract={The focus of this paper is on combination of artificial neural-network (ANN) forecasters with application to the prediction of daily natural gas consumption needed by gas utilities. ANN forecasters can model the complex relationship between weather parameters and previous gas consumption with the future consumption. A two-stage system is proposed with the first stage containing two ANN forecasters, a multilayer feedforward ANN and a functional link ANN. These forecasters are initially trained with the error backpropagation algorithm, but an adaptive strategy is employed to adjust their weights during online forecasting. The second stage consists of a combination module to mix the two individual forecasts produced in the first stage. Eight different combination algorithms are examined, they are based on: averaging, recursive least squares, fuzzy logic, feedforward ANN, functional link ANN, temperature space approach, Karmarkar's linear programming algorithm (1984) and adaptive mixture of local experts (modular neural networks). The performance is tested on real data from six different gas utilities. The results indicate that combination strategies based on a single ANN outperform the other approaches},

	pages={89},
	abstract={This thesis presents the detection of time series outliers. The data set used in this work is provided by the GasDay Project at Marquette University, which produces mathematical models to predict the consumption of natural gas for Local Distribution Companies (LDCs). Flow with no outliers is required to develop and train accurate models. GasDay is using statistical approaches motivated by normally distributed samples such as the 3 - σ rule and the 5 - σ rule to aid the experts in detecting outliers in residuals from the models. However, the Jarque-Bera statistical test shows that the residuals from the GasDay models are not normally distributed. We present an explanation of Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and how it is used to detect time series outliers. We have introduced a new application for the DBSCAN algorithm by adapting it to detect outliers in natural gas flow. The performance of DBSCAN is compared with GasDay's existing technique. Five data sets from temperature-sensitive operating areas with identified outliers and 1000 data sets with synthetic outliers are used in the evaluation process. The 1000 synthetic data sets are prepared using the same empirical distribution as one of the identified data set. This work indicates that DBSCAN has shown some improvement in detecting outliers over GasDays existing technique and merits further exploration.},

	journal={IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing},
	volume={13},
	number={5},
	pages={984-992},
	abstract={Eigenvoice-based methods have been shown to be effective for fast speaker adaptation when only a small amount of adaptation data, say, less than 10 s, is available. At the heart of the method is principal component analysis (PCA) employed to find the most important eigenvoices. In this paper, we postulate that nonlinear PCA using kernel methods may be even more effective. The eigenvoices thus derived will be called kernel eigenvoices (KEV), and we will call our new adaptation method kernel eigenvoice speaker adaptation. However, unlike the standard eigenvoice (EV) method, an adapted speaker model found by the kernel eigenvoice method resides in the high-dimensional kernel-induced feature space, which, in general, cannot be mapped back to an exact preimage in the input speaker supervector space. Consequently, it is not clear how to obtain the constituent Gaussians of the adapted model that are needed for the computation of state observation likelihoods during the estimation of eigenvoice weights and subsequent decoding. Our solution is the use of composite kernels in such a way that state observation likelihoods can be computed using only kernel functions without the need of a speaker-adapted model in the input supervector space. In this paper, we investigate two different composite kernels for KEV adaptation: direct sum kernel and tensor product kernel. In an evaluation on the TIDIGITS task, it is found that KEV speaker adaptation using both forms of composite Gaussian kernels are equally effective, and they outperform a speaker-independent model and adapted models found by EV, MAP, or MLLR adaptation using 2.1 and 4.1 s of speech. For example, with 2.1 s of adaptation data, KEV adaptation outperforms the speaker-independent model by 27.5\%, whereas EV, MAP, or MLLR adaptation are not effective at all.},

This thesis develops a number of daily forecasting models for test the possibility to extend the weather inputs in the current method for three different operating areas. Our goal is to improve the accuracy of our forecast by extending the number of inputs used by the existing GasDay model. We present a detailed explanation of the identification of the significance for each of the new weather input candidates. The significance of the new weather inputs was tested by statistical hypothesis testing, by forecasting performance testing, and by unusual day evaluation. We show that with some combinations of additional weather instruments, the accuracy of the forecast is improved. For most gas utilities, the primary use of natural gas is for space heating, so temperature is a critical factor when we build forecast models. In this thesis, we develop a method to split the Heating Degree Day (HDD) term into smaller pieces and generate the forecast based on these small factors. We name the method that developed as Multiple Weather Station (MWS) model in Chapter 4. We show that the MWS model yields better results compared to the existing method.},

	title={Surrogate Time Series},
	journal={Physica D},
	volume={142},
	pages={346-382},
	abstract={Before we apply nonlinear techniques, e.g. those inspired by chaos theory, to dynamical phenomena occurring in nature, it is necessary to first ask if the use of such advanced techniques is justified by the data. While many processes in nature seem very unlikely a priori to be linear, the possible nonlinear nature might not be evident in specific aspects of their dynamics. The method of surrogate data has become a very popular tool to address such a question. However, while it was meant to provide a statistically rigorous, foolproof framework, some limitations and caveats have shown up in its practical use. In this paper, recent efforts to understand the caveats, avoid the pitfalls, and to overcome some of the limitations, are reviewed and augmented by new material. In particular, we will discuss specific as well as more general approaches to constrained randomisation, providing a full range of examples. New algorithms will be introduced for unevenly sampled and multivariate data and for surrogate spike trains. The main limitation, which lies in the interpretability of the test results, will be illustrated through instructive case studies. We will also discuss some implementational aspects of the realisation of these methods in the TISEAN software package.},

	abstract={Abstract This paper provides detailed information about team Leustagos’ approach to the wind power forecasting track of GEFCom 2012. The task was to predict the hourly power generation at seven wind farms, 48 hours ahead. The problem was addressed by extracting time- and weather-related features, which were used to build gradient-boosted decision trees and linear regression models. This approach achieved first place in both the public and private leaderboards.},

	journal={Journal of Product Innovation Management},
	volume={2},
	number={1},
	pages={45-55},
	abstract={There has been a lot of interest in diffusion models as a basis for prelaunch estimates of the sales of new products, and indeed there have been several models developed that have achieved fairly good acceptance by new product managers. One of the limitations of such models, however, has been the requirement that a sales history for the new product, even a short one from a test market, for example, be available to derive the parameters of the model. For some types of products—consumer durables, services, industrial products, for example— a sales history isn't available. In this article, Professor Robert Thomas suggests some steps toward the development of models that incorporate the attractive features of diffusion models. His approach is to use, in a systematic way, the sales histories of products that can be considered to have analogous features from a buyer's point of view. He illustrates the approach by forecasting the sales of a new service.},

	pages={586-591},
	abstract={An approach to the detection and identification of human faces is presented, and a working, near-real-time face recognition system which tracks a subject's head and then recognizes the person by comparing characteristics of the face to those of known individuals is described. This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space (`face space') that best encodes the variation among known face images. The face space is defined by the `eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner},

	title={Surrogate Data Analysis and Stochastic Chaotic Modelling: Application to Stock Exchange Returns Series},
	institution={Society for Computational Economics},
	note={Computing in Economics and Finance 2004},
	abstract={We investigate for evidence of complex-deterministic dynamics in financial returns time series. By combining the Surrogate Data Analysis inferential framework with the MG-GARCH (Kyrtsou and Terraza, 2003) modelling approach, we examine whether the sequences are characterized by aperiodic and nonlinear deterministic cycles or pure randomness. Our results support the hypothesis of complex nonlinear and non-stochastic dynamics in the data generating processes. According to our approach, markets can be assumed to be highly complex, high-dimensional, open and dissipative dynamical systems that need feedback as well as other kinds of inputs in order to operate. These inputs may come in the guise of noise or news. The inputs may also control the evolution of the system dynamics and the knowledge of their nature may allow us to forecast the future states of the market with greater accuracy. To this extent the MG-GARCH model provides a valuable insight on how a feedback mechanism can operate within the structure of stock returns processes and explain stylized facts.},
